# Electron OTE

This is the source code for an electron wrapper around the online transcription editor (OTE) developed for the MUYA project. 

The OTE code is included as a submodule.

This is the source code used to create packaged/zipped versions that run on windows and mac (and linux if required).

## Requirements

* node.js 
* node package manager (npm)
* wine64 to compile for windows on linux (and perhaps mac)
* jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) optional but if not used version number must be manually altered in the package.json file before running .sh file

## Installation example for Ubuntu

First ensure you have the required packages

`sudo apt install nodejs`

`sudo apt install npm`

`sudo apt install wine64`

`sudo apt install jq`

Clone this repository

Move into the cloned directory and initialise the submodule

`git submodule init`

`git submodule update`

Get the required javascript packages using npm

`npm install electron --save-dev`

`npm install electron-packager --save-dev`

`npm install jquery@^3.5.1 --save`

`npm install codemirror --save`

## To run

To check the installation and run the electron OTE locally you can run it on the command line with the following command

`./node_modules/.bin/electron .`

## To package

To package for windows and mac

`./make_MUYA_electron_packages.sh [version number]`

The packaged versions will be available in the directory `release-builds`. 

The zip versions will be created as siblings of the cloned directory.
